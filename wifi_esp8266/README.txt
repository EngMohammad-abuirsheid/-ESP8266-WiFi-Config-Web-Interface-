Configuring Wi-Fi Credentials on ESP8266 with Web Interface
The ESP8266 is a versatile and widely used microcontroller with built-in Wi-Fi capabilities. One common use case is connecting it to a Wi-Fi network so it can communicate with other devices or the internet. This article will guide you through the process of creating a web interface to configure Wi-Fi credentials on an ESP8266 module.

Purpose of the Code
The code provided in this project allows you to set up an ESP8266 module to act as a Wi-Fi access point (AP). When you power on the ESP8266, it creates its own Wi-Fi network to which you can connect using a mobile device or computer.

The main purpose of this code is to provide an easy way to configure the ESP8266's Wi-Fi settings without needing to hard-code them into the firmware. With this code, you can:

Access a web page hosted by the ESP8266 to enter your Wi-Fi network name (SSID) and password.
Save these credentials to the ESP8266's EEPROM memory.
Have the ESP8266 attempt to connect to the configured Wi-Fi network on demand.
How It Works
Here's a step-by-step explanation of how the code works:

Setting up Wi-Fi AP Mode: Upon startup, the ESP8266 is configured to act as a Wi-Fi access point (AP) with a predefined SSID and password. Devices can connect to this AP to configure Wi-Fi settings.

Accessing the Configuration Page: When you connect to the ESP8266's Wi-Fi network, you can open a web browser and enter a specific IP address (e.g., http://192.168.4.1) to access a configuration web page hosted by the ESP8266.

Entering Wi-Fi Credentials: On the configuration page, you can enter your desired Wi-Fi SSID and password. These are then sent to the ESP8266 when you click the "Save" button.

Saving Credentials: The ESP8266 saves the entered credentials to its EEPROM memory. This allows the credentials to persist even after a power cycle.

Connecting to Wi-Fi: After saving the credentials, you can choose to have the ESP8266 attempt to connect to the configured Wi-Fi network by clicking a "Connect" button on the web page. This is a manual step to ensure you connect at the right time.

Use Cases
This code can be particularly useful in various scenarios:

Field Deployment: When deploying ESP8266-based devices in the field, you can use this code to configure Wi-Fi credentials on-site without needing to reprogram the devices.
Guest Networks: If you frequently switch between different Wi-Fi networks, you can use this code to easily switch the ESP8266 to a new network by configuring it through the web interface.
IoT Projects: In Internet of Things (IoT) projects, you may need to configure multiple devices with different Wi-Fi networks. This code simplifies the setup process.
Getting Started
To get started with this code:

Upload the code to your ESP8266 module using the Arduino IDE.
Power on the ESP8266, and it will create an AP with a predefined SSID and password.
Connect your device (e.g., smartphone, laptop) to the ESP8266's Wi-Fi network.
Open a web browser and enter the ESP8266's IP address (usually http://192.168.4.1) to access the configuration page.
Enter your Wi-Fi SSID and password, and click "Save."
Optionally, click "Connect" to have the ESP8266 connect to the configured Wi-Fi network.
Conclusion
The provided code simplifies the process of configuring Wi-Fi credentials on an ESP8266 module. By creating a web interface, it allows for easy and flexible setup, making it a valuable tool for various projects and use cases. Whether you're deploying IoT devices or frequently switching between Wi-Fi networks, this code can save you time and effort in managing Wi-Fi configurations.

Happy building and connecting with your ESP8266 devices!
